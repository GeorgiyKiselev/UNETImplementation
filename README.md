# UNETImplementation
Currently broken. This is on the back-burner until I find time to fix it.
Attemtping to implement a UNET architecture based on the archvie paper for the issue of segmentation for BRAIN MRIs, based on the kaggle dataset. 

There is an issue with the data loader due to file names. I will fix this error some time in the future.
